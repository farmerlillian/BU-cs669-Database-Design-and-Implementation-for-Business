Master of Science in Software Development (MSSD) at Boston University
This is the Final Project of CS669.

This database is designed for the "Pomodoro-Workout clock" I completed in CS521.
With this database
1.	the program can support  multiple accounts. 
2.	The users can create groups to support and encourage each other
3.	The users can participate a luckydraw after getting every 10 pomodoros.
4.	Groups can participate some competition and win a reward 
5.	Easy to show a lot of records statistics, such as how many time you have studied or workout today, this week, this month; whether you achieve the goal you set ; how many days you have insisted on focusing, etc .
6.	Easy to update the workout videos.
